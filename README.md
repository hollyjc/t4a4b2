# Documentation

## Part A
R1 - My website will be a blog application. Users will be able to make accounts, log in and log out of their accounts, assign a profile picture to their account, make blog posts and read others blog posts. The purpose of this blog is for animal lovers. People can post pictures and stories about their animals. This is not only a blog for posting pictures of animals but it is also a neurodiverse friendly application. The colours of the blog pages will be neutral and muted. This is because people who are neurodiverse (like ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and ADHD (Attention Deficit Disorder - inattentive and hyperactive) can find brightly coloured websites with lots of bright colours and things like buttons that make noise when you click them, flashing messages, etc too overstimulating, overwhelming and/or distracting. This makes trying to use the blog difficult for them. My making a straightforward blog that is still visually pleasing should eliminate the issue of overstimulation and distraction. The target audience is animal lovers of any age who would like to show off their animals and see other people’s animals. However, I aim for this to be an inclusive platform and have things that cater to the neurodiverse community’s needs (as mentioned above). The tech stack will include Python, Flask, Jinja, CSS, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap and Postgres. The back-end will be made up with Python and Flask, the Front-end will be done with Jinja to connect the back and front-end together, as well as CSS and Bootstrap. The Postgres Database will store hashed user information like passwords, emails and usernames.

R4 - User Stories
 Make account

As a user of this website, I need to be able to make an account so that I can upload blog posts to the blog, as well as have a profile picture. If I do not have a profile picture I should have a default picture assigned by the website to my profile. As a user to make an account, I need the website to have a clear button to make an account, I need this button to make me to a page where I can register an account, be notified my account has been made and then login to my  newly created account. I will be done when my account has been created successfully and I can log on, and upload blog posts to the website.

Create blog post

As a user I want to post a blog post about my pet, so that I can interact with other users and show other users of the website my pet. Given that the user wants to make a post about their pet onto the blog website, there will need to be a button to clearly create a blog post, and a clear button or hyperlink for others to view their post. Then the user will be able to achieve their goal.

Log out of account

As a user I want to be able to log out of my account, so that if I share my computer and/or mobile device with others my account will be secure and other people will not have access to my account. Given that the user wants to be able to log out of their account, there needs to be a clear button in the header/navigation bar of the website so that the user is able to easily log themselves out of their account when they wish to.








Developer checking website traffic

As a developer with permission to access the admin rights of the website I want to check the traffic to the website, so I can make sure that the website can handle the traffic and see if there are any trends regarding traffic (for example, being busier at 6-9pm as opposed to 9-11am). Given that the developer would like to check the traffic to the website, they will need to be given access to the heroku dashboard/console, then they will check the traffic.

User utilising website for blogging

As a user I want to be able to register for an account and then log in to the registered account and posts blogs. Given that the user wants to register an account, login and make blog posts, the user must be able to easily sign up with an email and password. To do this there needs to be a clear ‘Register’ button in the navigation, this will need to alert the user when the account has been created successfully. Then, the user wants to login, there will need to be another button in the navigation bar that the user can click to easily login to their account, the website should redirect the user when they are successfully logged in to their home page. Given that the user wants to post blogs, there will need to be a clear section and button where the user can post a blog.
